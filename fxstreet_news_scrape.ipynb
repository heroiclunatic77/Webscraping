The US Dollar (USD) is the official currency of the United States of America, and the ‘de facto’ currency of a significant number of other countries where it is found in circulation alongside local notes. It is the most heavily traded currency in the world, accounting for over 88% of all global foreign exchange turnover, or an average of $6.6 trillion in transactions per day, according to data from 2022. Following the second world war, the USD took over from the British Pound as the world’s reserve currency. For most of its history, the US Dollar was backed by Gold, until the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1971 when the Gold Standard went away. How do the decisions of the Federal Reserve impact the US Dollar? The most important single factor impacting on the value of the US Dollar is monetary policy, which is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability (control inflation) and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these two goals is by adjusting interest rates. When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed’s 2% target, the Fed will raise rates, which helps the USD value. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates, which weighs on the Greenback. What is Quantitative Easing and how does it influence the US Dollar? In extreme situations, the Federal Reserve can also print more Dollars and enact quantitative easing (QE). QE is the process by which the Fed substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. It is a non-standard policy measure used when credit has dried up because banks will not lend to each other (out of the fear of counterparty default).

Other factors include market sentiment – whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) – with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.</p>\\n</section>\\n<input id=\"accordion1\" type=\"checkbox\">\\n<section class=\"fxs-faq-module-section\">\\n<h3 class=\"fxs-faq-module-header\"><label for=\"accordion1\"> <span>How do the decisions of the Bank of Canada impact the Canadian Dollar?</span> </label></h3>\\n\\n<p class=\"fxs-faq-module-content\">The Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.</p>\\n</section>\\n<input id=\"accordion2\" type=\"checkbox\">\\n<section class=\"fxs-faq-module-section\">\\n<h3 class=\"fxs-faq-module-header\"><label for=\"accordion2\"> <span>How does the price of Oil impact the Canadian Dollar?</span> </label></h3>\\n\\n<p class=\"fxs-faq-module-content\">The price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada’s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.</p>\\n</section>\\n<input id=\"accordion3\" type=\"checkbox\">\\n<section class=\"fxs-faq-module-section\">\\n<h3 class=\"fxs-faq-module-header\"><label for=\"accordion3\"> <span>How does inflation data impact the value of the Canadian Dollar?</span> </label></h3>\\n\\n<p class=\"fxs-faq-module-content\">While inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in Canada’s case is the Canadian Dollar.</p>\\n</section>\\n<input id=\"accordion4\" type=\"checkbox\">\\n<section class=\"fxs-faq-module-section\">\\n<h3 class=\"fxs-faq-module-header\"><label for=\"accordion4\"> <span>How does economic data influence the value of the Canadian Dollar?</span> </label></h3>\\n\\n<p class=\"fxs-faq-module-content\">Macroeconomic data releases gauge the health of the economy and can have an impact on the Canadian Dollar. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the CAD. A strong economy is good for the Canadian Dollar. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the Bank of Canada to put up interest rates, leading to a stronger currency. If economic data is weak, however, the CAD is likely to fall.</p>\\n</section>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n', 'ContentPlainText': \"USD/CAD gains traction to around 1.4340 in Wednesday’s late American session.

The Fed officials are scheduled to speak later in the day, including Michelle Bowman, Beth Hammack and Patrick Harker. The hawkish comment from policymakers could lift the USD against the Canadian Dollar (CAD) in the near term. Canadian Dollar FAQs What key factors drive the Canadian Dollar? The key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada’s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada’s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment – whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) – with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar. How do the decisions of the Bank of Canada impact the Canadian Dollar? The Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive. How does the price of Oil impact the Canadian Dollar? The price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada’s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD. How does inflation data impact the value of the Canadian Dollar? While inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in Canada’s case is the Canadian Dollar. How does economic data influence the value of the Canadian Dollar? Macroeconomic data releases gauge the health of the economy and can have an impact on the Canadian Dollar. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the CAD. A strong economy is good for the Canadian Dollar. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the Bank of Canada to put up interest rates, leading to a stronger currency. If economic data is weak, however, the CAD is likely to fall.\", 'VersionDate': '2025-02-26T23:15:00Z', 'VersionDateDisplay': '42 minutes ago', 'SEO': {'MetaTitle': 'USD/CAD extends upside to near 1.4350 ahead of US GDP release', 'MetaDescription': 'The USD/CAD pair extends the rally to near 1.4340 during the late American session on Wednesday.

Inflation FAQs What is inflation? Inflation measures the rise in the price of a representative basket of goods and services. Headline inflation is usually expressed as a percentage change on a month-on-month (MoM) and year-on-year (YoY) basis. Core inflation excludes more volatile elements such as food and fuel which can fluctuate because of geopolitical and seasonal factors. Core inflation is the figure economists focus on and is the level targeted by central banks, which are mandated to keep inflation at a manageable level, usually around 2%. What is the Consumer Price Index (CPI)? The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the change in prices of a basket of goods and services over a period of time. It is usually expressed as a percentage change on a month-on-month (MoM) and year-on-year (YoY) basis. Core CPI is the figure targeted by central banks as it excludes volatile food and fuel inputs. When Core CPI rises above 2% it usually results in higher interest rates and vice versa when it falls below 2%. Since higher interest rates are positive for a currency, higher inflation usually results in a stronger currency. The opposite is true when inflation falls. What is the impact of inflation on foreign exchange? Although it may seem counter-intuitive, high inflation in a country pushes up the value of its currency and vice versa for lower inflation. This is because the central bank will normally raise interest rates to combat the higher inflation, which attract more global capital inflows from investors looking for a lucrative place to park their money. How does inflation influence the price of Gold? Formerly, Gold was the asset investors turned to in times of high inflation because it preserved its value, and whilst investors will often still buy Gold for its safe-haven properties in times of extreme market turmoil, this is not the case most of the time. This is because when inflation is high, central banks will put up interest rates to combat it. Higher interest rates are negative for Gold because they increase the opportunity-cost of holding Gold vis-a-vis an interest-bearing asset or placing the money in a cash deposit account. On the flipside, lower inflation tends to be positive for Gold as it brings interest rates down, making the bright metal a more viable investment alternative.\", 'VersionDate': '2025-02-26T21:13:24.323Z', 'VersionDateDisplay': '21:13 GMT', 'SEO': {'MetaTitle': 'US Dollar gets some air ahead of GDP and PCE data', 'MetaDescription': 'The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the performance of the US Dollar against a basket of six major currencies, is attempting a modest recovery on Wednesday but remains near yearly lows at 106.50.

The US Dollar (USD) is the official currency of the United States of America, and the ‘de facto’ currency of a significant number of other countries where it is found in circulation alongside local notes. It is the most heavily traded currency in the world, accounting for over 88% of all global foreign exchange turnover, or an average of $6.6 trillion in transactions per day, according to data from 2022. Following the second world war, the USD took over from the British Pound as the world’s reserve currency. For most of its history, the US Dollar was backed by Gold, until the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1971 when the Gold Standard went away. How do the decisions of the Federal Reserve impact the US Dollar? The most important single factor impacting on the value of the US Dollar is monetary policy, which is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability (control inflation) and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these two goals is by adjusting interest rates.

Other factors include market sentiment – whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) – with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar.</p>\\n</section>\\n<input id=\"accordion1\" type=\"checkbox\">\\n<section class=\"fxs-faq-module-section\">\\n<h3 class=\"fxs-faq-module-header\"><label for=\"accordion1\"> <span>How do the decisions of the Bank of Canada impact the Canadian Dollar?</span> </label></h3>\\n\\n<p class=\"fxs-faq-module-content\">The Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive.</p>\\n</section>\\n<input id=\"accordion2\" type=\"checkbox\">\\n<section class=\"fxs-faq-module-section\">\\n<h3 class=\"fxs-faq-module-header\"><label for=\"accordion2\"> <span>How does the price of Oil impact the Canadian Dollar?</span> </label></h3>\\n\\n<p class=\"fxs-faq-module-content\">The price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada’s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD.</p>\\n</section>\\n<input id=\"accordion3\" type=\"checkbox\">\\n<section class=\"fxs-faq-module-section\">\\n<h3 class=\"fxs-faq-module-header\"><label for=\"accordion3\"> <span>How does inflation data impact the value of the Canadian Dollar?</span> </label></h3>\\n\\n<p class=\"fxs-faq-module-content\">While inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in Canada’s case is the Canadian Dollar.</p>\\n</section>\\n<input id=\"accordion4\" type=\"checkbox\">\\n<section class=\"fxs-faq-module-section\">\\n<h3 class=\"fxs-faq-module-header\"><label for=\"accordion4\"> <span>How does economic data influence the value of the Canadian Dollar?</span> </label></h3>\\n\\n<p class=\"fxs-faq-module-content\">Macroeconomic data releases gauge the health of the economy and can have an impact on the Canadian Dollar. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the CAD. A strong economy is good for the Canadian Dollar. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the Bank of Canada to put up interest rates, leading to a stronger currency. If economic data is weak, however, the CAD is likely to fall.</p>\\n</section>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n', 'ContentPlainText': \"USD/CAD gains traction to around 1.4340 in Wednesday’s late American session.

This, in turn, undermines the commodity-linked Loonie as Canada is the largest oil exporter to theUnited States (US), and lower crudeoil prices tend to have a negative impact on the CAD value. Furthermore, the renewed US tariff threats weigh on the CAD and act as a tailwind for USD/CAD. US President Donald Trump confirmed plans to impose 25% tariffs on Canadian goods and 10% on Canadian energy exports by April 2, reversing earlier delays tied to Canada’s border security measures. It's another month, which is obviously good news for Canada, but the tariff uncertainty is a real drag on the Canadian economy, said Adam Button, chief currency analyst at ForexLive. The US Dollar (USD) rebounds from 11-week lows as traders assess the strength of the economy andtariff outlook. Richmond Federal Reserve (Fed) President Tom Barkin said on Tuesday that he will follow a wait-and-see approach regarding Fed interest rate policy until it is clear inflation is returning to the central bank's 2% goal given the current uncertainty surrounding the economy. The Fed officials are scheduled to speak later in the day, including Michelle Bowman, Beth Hammack and Patrick Harker. The hawkish comment from policymakers could lift the USD against the Canadian Dollar (CAD) in the near term. Canadian Dollar FAQs What key factors drive the Canadian Dollar? The key factors driving the Canadian Dollar (CAD) are the level of interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), the price of Oil, Canada’s largest export, the health of its economy, inflation and the Trade Balance, which is the difference between the value of Canada’s exports versus its imports. Other factors include market sentiment – whether investors are taking on more risky assets (risk-on) or seeking safe-havens (risk-off) – with risk-on being CAD-positive. As its largest trading partner, the health of the US economy is also a key factor influencing the Canadian Dollar. How do the decisions of the Bank of Canada impact the Canadian Dollar? The Bank of Canada (BoC) has a significant influence on the Canadian Dollar by setting the level of interest rates that banks can lend to one another. This influences the level of interest rates for everyone. The main goal of the BoC is to maintain inflation at 1-3% by adjusting interest rates up or down. Relatively higher interest rates tend to be positive for the CAD. The Bank of Canada can also use quantitative easing and tightening to influence credit conditions, with the former CAD-negative and the latter CAD-positive. How does the price of Oil impact the Canadian Dollar? The price of Oil is a key factor impacting the value of the Canadian Dollar. Petroleum is Canada’s biggest export, so Oil price tends to have an immediate impact on the CAD value. Generally, if Oil price rises CAD also goes up, as aggregate demand for the currency increases. The opposite is the case if the price of Oil falls. Higher Oil prices also tend to result in a greater likelihood of a positive Trade Balance, which is also supportive of the CAD. How does inflation data impact the value of the Canadian Dollar? While inflation had always traditionally been thought of as a negative factor for a currency since it lowers the value of money, the opposite has actually been the case in modern times with the relaxation of cross-border capital controls. Higher inflation tends to lead central banks to put up interest rates which attracts more capital inflows from global investors seeking a lucrative place to keep their money. This increases demand for the local currency, which in Canada’s case is the Canadian Dollar. How does economic data influence the value of the Canadian Dollar? Macroeconomic data releases gauge the health of the economy and can have an impact on the Canadian Dollar. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the CAD. A strong economy is good for the Canadian Dollar. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the Bank of Canada to put up interest rates, leading to a stronger currency. If economic data is weak, however, the CAD is likely to fall.\", 'VersionDate': '2025-02-26T23:15:00Z', 'VersionDateDisplay': 'Feb 26, 23:15 GMT', 'SEO': {'MetaTitle': 'USD/CAD extends upside to near 1.4350 ahead of US GDP release', 'MetaDescription': 'The USD/CAD pair extends the rally to near 1.4340 during the late American session on Wednesday.

It reported that revenue grew by a whopping $39.3bn, higher than the $38bn expected last quarter, and a 45% increase on the $22bn of revenue it reported a year ago. Net income, or profit, also jumped to $22.09bn, up from $19.36bn in Q3, and gross profit margin was in line with expectations at 73%. The forecast for future revenues, which is one of the most anticipated parts of Nvidia’s results, also saw a decent uptick, the company expects revenues for this quarter to be $43bn +/- 2% for Q1.</p>\\n\\n<p>The stock whipsawed in the after-hours market.

Firstly, gross profit margin ‘only’ met expectations and the forecast for Q1 was 71%, below estimates. To put this into context, Microsoft managed gross profit margin of 68.7%, and chip maker AMD reported gross profit margin of just over 50% for Q4. Nvidia’s profit margins hold up well against its peers, and there is also a good reason why gross profit margin is slowing, albeit from a high level: margins are being squeezed by bringing new and more complicated products to&nbsp; market, like the Blackwell chip. It’s a tough crowd out there, but we do not think that a small drop in the profit margin is enough to call this a ‘bad report’, and investors may eventually look past the issue with gross margin forecasts.</p>\\n\\n<p>However, although the share price is now rallying, it has done so by less than average on results day for Nvidia.

The new chip contributed $11bn to revenue in Q4 and said that demand for Blackwell chips is ‘amazing’ and is achieving ‘billions of dollars of sales in Q1’.</p>\\n\\n<h3 class=\"fxs_headline_medium\">DeepSeek: it’s good for us, according to Nvidia execs</h3>\\n\\n<p>Nvidia executives also faced some tough questions on DeepSeek, China’s new AI kid on the block. The company had obviously spent a long time rehearsing how to spin the DeepSeek threat. Nvidia now sees the new way of training AI models using DeepSeek’s blueprint &nbsp;as a boost to demand for Nvidia chips, and not just any old chips, but their most advanced ones. Any fears about demand for Blackwell chips in the face of DeepSeek are being put to bed by Nvidia.

These restrictions have been extended by Trump, so Nvidia sees Chinese revenue staying the same for this quarter, which is not bad considering the mountain it faces to do business in the world’s second largest economy. It may also boost investor sentiment that issues in China are not impacting future revenue growth.</p>\\n\\n<h3 class=\"fxs_headline_medium\">Can investors look through some pockets of weakness in Nvidia’s earnings report?</h3>\\n\\n<p>Customer concentration remains a risk for the chip maker and &nbsp;Nvidia is still reliant on the same large customers, including Microsoft, Meta, Super Micro and Google.

Q4 gaming revenue and networking revenues were lower year-on-year, and inventory levels rose. Inventories totaled $10.1bn last quarter, which is higher than the $7.7bn recorded at the end of September 2024.

The company’s cash pile rose to $43.2bn, up from $26bn a year ago. This could help Nvidia weather any future storms in the AI sector, or a downturn in the US economy, as a cash pile that big means that investors might start to focus on Nvidia’s defensive qualities.</p>\\n\\n<p>Overall, this is a strong earnings report, but the landscape for AI has changed, and so has investors’ enthusiasm for it. The below average gains in Nvidia’s stock price post this earnings report is a sign that tech is not the only sector out there, and US exceptionalism is losing its luster. Investors are choosing Asia, China in particular, and Europe, over US tech names right now, and we do not think that Nvidia’s results will change that.
